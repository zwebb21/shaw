        <h3 class="abouthead">How It Started</h3>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Lily who had a passion for baking.
          She loved to experiment
          with different flavors and ingredients in her kitchen and dreamed of one day owning her own cupcake business.

        <h3 class="abouthead">Challenges </h3>
        <p class="about-paragraph">After completing pastry school and gaining experience working in various bakeries, Lily finally saved enough
          money to open her own shop. She named it "Sugar High Cupcakes" and decorated the walls with pastel colors and
          cute cupcake-themed accents.</p>

        <p class="about-paragraph"> At first, business was slow. Lily worked tirelessly to perfect her recipes and spread the word about her
          shop. She handed out flyers on the street, offered free samples to customers, and even set up a cupcake booth
          at local events.</p>

        <p class="about-paragraph"> Years later, Lily's cupcake business was still going strong. She had a loyal following of customers and a
          team of skilled bakers who helped make her sweet dreams a reality. And she still felt just as passionate about
          baking as she did when she first started</p>

  <h3 class="History-Header">July 9th 1976</h3>
    <p class="about-paragraph">As word of mouth spread and Lily's reputation grew, 
      more and more customers began to come to Sugar High Cupcakes.<br />
      The demand for her delicious cupcakes was so high that she had to hire a team of bakers to help
        her keep up</p>

              <p class="about-paragraph">    
                      One of her most popular cupcakes was the "Strawberry Shortcake" 
                which had a tender vanilla cake base topped with sweet strawberries and whipped cream.<br /> 
                Another crowd-pleaser was the "Chocolate Overload" cupcake, 
                which had a rich chocolate cake base filled with melted chocolate and topped with even more chocolate ganache.</p>

                      <p class="about-paragraph"> Sugar High Cupcakes became the go-to place for special events and celebrations.
                          Brides and grooms would come to Lily to design custom cupcake <br> towers for their weddings, 
                          and birthday parties were made sweeter with Sugar High's cupcakes.</p></section>

learned that
was trying to center the navbar items in the middle of the navbar,.
used chatgpt to find the jstify -content-center 

use justify-content-center class is added to the <ul> element that contains the navbar items. This will center the items horizontally within the navbar.

You can also use other Bootstrap classes to customize the alignment further. For example, you can use align-items-center to vertically center the items within the navbar.
